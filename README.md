# 🐍 Python Data Engineering Hub

This repository provides a focused collection of hands-on projects and programming challenges designed to validate and enhance Python data engineering skills. The objective is to build robust, scalable, and production-ready data pipelines.

## Core Engineering Principles

All projects emphasize the practical application of:

* **Scalability:** Utilizing memory-efficient techniques (streaming, generators) for large-volume data processing.
* **Data Quality:** Implementing rigorous validation, logging, and error handling for data integrity.
* **Code Quality:** Adherence to modern Python best practices, including type hinting and modular design.
